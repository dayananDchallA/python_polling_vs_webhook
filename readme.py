𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘃𝘀 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗙𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗔𝗣𝗜 💻

When integrating payment systems into your web app, one critical task is ensuring you correctly verify the payment status. Whether you’re working with Stripe, PayPal, or another provider, you generally have two common approaches for checking payment status:

🌀 𝟭. 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱
With polling, you periodically send a request to the payment provider’s API to check the status of a payment.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:
1. Client initiates a payment.
2. Backend starts a background task to poll the payment provider API at intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds).
3. Status is updated after each check (pending, paid, failed).
4. Polling stops when the payment reaches a final status.

🟢 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀:
✅ Simple to implement.
✅ No need to configure external services like webhooks.

🔴 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀:
❌ 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲-𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲: Constantly hitting the API even when the status hasn’t changed.
❌ 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗱 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀: There could be a lag between checks.
❌ 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Not ideal for high-traffic apps.

🔄 𝟮. 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱
In contrast, webhooks offer a push-based model where the payment provider sends an HTTP request to your app when the payment status changes.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:
1. Client initiates a payment.
2. Your app exposes an endpoint to the payment provider.
3. When the payment status changes, the provider automatically sends a webhook to your endpoint.

🟢 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀:
✅ 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀: Get instant notification when the payment is completed or fails.
✅ 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁: Only responds when there’s an actual event (no wasted requests).

🔴 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀:
❌ 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝘂𝗽: Requires secure webhook verification and handling retries.
❌ 𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁: Payment provider must support webhooks.

💡 𝗪𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝘁𝗼 𝗨𝘀𝗲?
🚀 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 works well for smaller apps or 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘄𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱 by the payment provider.
🚀 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 are better suited for 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲, 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 where you need instant updates without unnecessary load on your server.

🔍 𝗣𝗿𝗼 𝘁𝗶𝗽: If available, 𝘄𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 are almost always the better option due to their efficiency and real-time nature, but 𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 is a reliable fallback when you need a simpler or more predictable setup.
